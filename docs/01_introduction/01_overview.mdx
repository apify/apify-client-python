## Introduction

The [Apify client for Python](https://github.com/apify/apify-client-python) is the official library to access the [Apify REST API](/api/v2) from your Python applications. It provides useful features like automatic retries and convenience functions that improve the experience of using the Apify API.

Key features:

- Synchronous and asynchronous interfaces for flexible integration
- Automatic retries for improved reliability
- JSON encoding with UTF-8 for all requests and responses
- Comprehensive API coverage for [Actors](/platform/actors), [datasets](/platform/storage/dataset), [key-value stores](/platform/storage/key-value-store), and more

## Next steps

Now that you're familiar with the basics, explore more advanced features:

- [Asyncio support](/concepts/asyncio-support) - Learn about asynchronous programming with the client
- Common use-case examples like:
  - [Passing an input to Actor](/api/client/python/docs/examples/passing-input-to-actor)
  - [Retrieve Actor data](/api/client/python/docs/examples/retrieve-actor-data)
- [API Reference](/api/client/python/reference) - Browse the complete API documentation
