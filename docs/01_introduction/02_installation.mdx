---

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Apify client, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- _An Apify account_
- _Python 3.10 or higher_: You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- _Python package manager_: While this guide uses [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), you can also use any package manager you want.

To verify that Python and pip are installed, run the following commands:

```sh
python --version
```

```sh
pip --version
```

If these commands return the respective versions, you're ready to continue.

## Installation

The Apify client is available as the [`apify-client`](https://pypi.org/project/apify-client/) package on PyPI. To install it, run:

```sh
pip install apify-client
```

After installation, verify that the client is installed correctly by checking its version:

```sh
python -c 'import apify_client; print(apify_client.__version__)'
```
